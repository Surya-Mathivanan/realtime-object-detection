# Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv9

   This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv9 model, implemented in Python with PyTorch. The model detects various objects in video frames captured from the webcam, draws bounding boxes, and displays class labels with confidence scores.

## Requirements

   - Python 3.x
   - PyTorch
   - OpenCV
   - Ultralytics YOLO

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-object-detection.git
   cd real-time-object-detection
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - pip install torch opencv-python ultralytics

## Setup
  - Download the YOLOv9 model weights (e.g., yolov9c.pt) and place them in the project directory.
  - Make sure that you have a working camera connected to your device.

## Model Description
   - YOLOv9 is a state-of-the-art object detection model that can detect various objects in images and videos. The model is used here for detecting and classifying objects in video frames captured from the webcam.
